                    <p>Our positive discipline policy focuses on prevention, redirection, love, consistency, and firmness. We emphasize respect for others and property, explaining center rules frequently to ensure all children understand. Disagreements are expected, and we help children express feelings appropriately. We prevent problems, redirect behavior, discuss inappropriate actions, encourage making amends, and sometimes withdraw privileges. Time outs are used rarely, mainly for a brief cooling off period. We use positive behavior support strategies and welcome suggestions. Caregivers use positive methods such as praise, reminders, redirection, and brief supervised separation. Spanking, physical or verbal abuse, name-calling, and food or sleep deprivation are NEVER used. If issues persist, we hold a conference with parents to find a solution.</p>
